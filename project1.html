                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p> During the implementation of our bookkeeping application, we encountered an
                    interesting challenge related to the display of receipt data from multiple
                    users. Specifically, we found that all receipt data from different users were
                    being shown together in the RecyclerView since we had just users table and
                    receipts table in our database, which was not ideal.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="solution">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Creating a separate table for each user is not a practical solution as it would
                    lead to severe data redundancy and make managing and organizing data difficult.
                    Instead, we implemented a foreign key SQLite statement that joins the receipts
                    table to a separate user table. By adding user_email as a primary key to the
                    user table and a foreign key to the receipts table, we were able to link each
                    receipt record to the corresponding user record. This allows users to view receipt
                    data for their account only.</p>
                <p> This solved the challenge of displaying receipt data from multiple users and also
                    improved the overall organization and management of data in our application.</p>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="summary">
            <div class="summary-title">
                <h1>Summary</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="summary-para">
            <p> In developing a bookkeeping application using Android Studio, we learned several
                important skills that are applicable to many different types of app development.
                For example, utilize the Google Maps API to track the user's current location,
                implement both implicit and explicit intents to navigate between different app
                activities and features, use shared preferences and SQLite database to store and
                retrieve user data as well as manage the database reasonably and implement a
                RecyclerView to present receipts and related data in an organized and user-friendly
                manner.</p>
            <p>Overall, this project helped us develop our skills in Android development,
                programming, problem-solving, and testing and debugging for building a real-world
                application. These skills are highly valuable for us as aspiring app developers</p>
